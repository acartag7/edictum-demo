"""Shared contracts for the file organizer demo.

Used by demo_with.py (and examples/demo_sdk.py) to govern tool calls.
demo_without.py intentionally skips these to show what happens without
governance.

These demonstrate Edictum's governance primitives:
- Built-in preconditions (deny_sensitive_reads)
- Custom preconditions (no_destructive_commands, require_target_dir)
- Session contracts (limit_total_operations)
- Postconditions (check_bash_errors)
