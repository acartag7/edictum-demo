# Customer Support Scenario

Demonstrates Edictum governance for a customer support AI agent.

## What it demonstrates
- Data minimization: PII (emails, phones, addresses, partial card numbers) detected and redacted in all tool output
- Billing access control: only senior agents, billing specialists, and supervisors can view billing data
- Refund limits: refunds over $500 require supervisor or billing specialist role
- Escalation governance: escalations require a documented reason
- Ticket lifecycle: only senior agents and supervisors can close/resolve tickets
- Session limits: caps on total tool calls and per-tool call limits

## Run

```bash
# CLI -- governed (uses LangChainAdapter)
python customer-support/support_agent.py
python customer-support/support_agent.py --role support_agent        # denied on billing
python customer-support/support_agent.py --role billing_specialist   # full billing access
python customer-support/support_agent.py --role supervisor           # full access + high refunds
python customer-support/support_agent.py --mode observe              # shadow mode

# CLI -- unguarded (shows what happens without governance)
python customer-support/support_agent_unguarded.py
python customer-support/support_agent_unguarded.py --test jailbreak
python customer-support/support_agent_unguarded.py --test data_harvesting
```
